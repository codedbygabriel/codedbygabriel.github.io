# My Online Space/Resume/Blog! Ი𐑼

There's nothing too special on this repo other than the link to the [website](https://codedbygabriel.github.io/).

Most of my early days on the internet where marked by *websites, blogs, strange places with no apparent reason to exist* and i love it!

That's the reason i created this website, to serve the purpose of my old desires
and dreams: **be heard**.

- [x] The base site itself;
- [x] Creation of my skills synopsis;
- [ ] Creation of BlogPosts structure;
- More!
